The proposed solution, Memora – An AI-Based Memory Assistance System, is a web￾based application built using modern tools such as Flask for the backend and React.js for 
the frontend. These technologies were chosen for their scalability, efficiency, and ability 
to provide a seamless user experience. Memora integrates several key components that 
together provide both practical and emotional support for individuals with memory￾related conditions. These components include:
 Facial Recognition using Python’s face_recognition library to identify familiar 
people from images, helping users recognize and connect with loved ones.
 NLP Chatbot powered by the Google Gemini API to understand and respond 
naturally to user queries while continuously storing and recalling memory context, 
ensuring meaningful conversations.
 SQLite Database for securely storing reminders, past conversations, user data, and 
personal memories, ensuring that the system can provide continuity and relevant 
responses.
 Real-Time Alerts to provide timely medication and activity reminders, ensuring 
that important tasks are never missed and that users remain on track with their 
daily routines.

 User-Friendly Web Interface designed with simplicity in mind, ensuring that 
elderly users or their caregivers can easily navigate and interact with the system.
By integrating these AI techniques, Memora offers a comprehensive solution that helps 
individuals with memory loss live more independently, with greater dignity and peace of 
mind, while also offering emotional support through empathetic interactions.
